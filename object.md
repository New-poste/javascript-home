<p>An event in JavaScript is an action that occurs in the browser, such as a user clicking a button or scrolling a page. JavaScript event handling allows you to respond to these events by executing code.</p>

<p>To handle an event, you need to attach an event handler to the element that will generate the event. The event handler is a function that will be executed when the event occurs.</p>

<p>There are two ways to attach an event handler to an element:</p>
<p>
Using the onevent attribute: This is the older way of attaching an event handler. The onevent attribute is named after the event that you want to handle. For example, to handle a click event, you would use the onclick attribute.</p>
<p>Using the <span class='sas'>addEventListener()</span> method: This is the newer way of attaching an event handler. The <span class='sas'>addEventListener()</span> method takes two arguments: the name of the event and the function that will be executed when the event occurs.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to attach an event handler using the onevent attribute:</p>
 <div class="container-fixed source">
<pre><code class="javascript sid"> 
&lt;button onclick="myFunction()">Click Me&lt;/button></code>
</pre>
                  </div>
<p>This code will create a button with the text "Click Me". When the user clicks the button, the function <span class='sas'>myFunction() </span> will be executed.</p>

<p>Here is an example of how to attach an event handler using the <span class='sas'>addEventListener()</span> method:</p>
 <div class="container-fixed source">
<pre><code class="javascript sid"> 
const button = document.querySelector("button");
button.addEventListener("click", myFunction);</code>
</pre>
                  </div>
<p>This code will select the button with the id "button" and attach the event handler <span class='sas'>myFunction() </span> to the click event.</p>

<p>The <span class='sas'>myFunction() </span> function is the event handler. This function will be executed when the user clicks the button. The <span class='sas'>myFunction() </span>function can do anything you want it to do. It can change the text of the button, add an element to the page, or even open a new window.</p>
<p>
There are many different events that you can handle in JavaScript. Some of the most common events are:</p>

                  <Li><span class='sas'>click</span>: The user clicks an element.</Li>
              <Li><span class='sas'>mouseover</span>: The user moves the mouse over an element.</Li>
          <Li><span class='sas'>mouseout</span>: The user moves the mouse away from an element.</Li>
      <Li><span class='sas'>keydown</span>: The user presses a key on the keyboard.</Li>
  <Li><span class='sas'>keyup</span>: The user releases a key on the keyboard.</Li>
<Li><span class='sas'>scroll</span>: The user scrolls the page.</Li>
<Li><span class='sas'>load</span>: The page has finished loading.</Li>
<Li><span class='sas'>unload</span>: The page is about to unload.</Li>
